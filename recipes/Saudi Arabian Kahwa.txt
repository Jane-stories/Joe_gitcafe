Saudi Arabian Kahwa



In Saudi Arabia, cardamom is an ingredient used in coffee that is served with dates that are sweet and dried. The Bedouin tradition has the youngest person pour coffee for his elders.

1 tablespoon of preferably Arabic coffee
2 roughly ground tablespoons of cardamoms
2 cups of water
¼ teaspoons of saffron are optional
Warm the coffee on a low heat – add water and bring to boil. Remove from heat and filter once the coffee is settled. Then add cardamom and saffron and bring to boil once again. Simmer for 20 minutes before drinking.
